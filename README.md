<h2>Code Overview</h2>

<b>Data Structures and Algorithms</b> are building blocks of programming. Data structures enable us to organize and store data, whereas algorithms enable us to process that data in a meaningful sense. Totally there are <b>260 lecture codings</b> and assignments are on the way.

<h2>What is included</h2>

* Build the foundation from Mathematics, Bit Magic, Recursion, Arrays and other algorithms while practicing problems
* Learn and Implement Searching and Sorting Algorithms from basics to advance
* Master concepts of Matrix, Strings, Linked List, Stack, Queue and related data structures
* Become a pro at advanced concepts of Hashing, Graph, Tree, BST, Heap, Backtracking, DP etc.
* Learn Trie, Segment Tree and Disjoint Set from basics to advance
* Practice algorithms like Kruskals, Tarjans, Kosarajuâ€™s, Prims, Rabin Karp, KMP and many more
